		Corsten's teaching style
	</div>


	<p>
		I will provide structured 1:1 support to supplement lessons taught in school 
		in order to increase grades, confidence in, and enjoyment of science and maths 
		subjects.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Every one of us is individual, and this individuality extends to our learning, 
		memory and recall. 1:1 private tuition provided by Douglas Tutoring aims to identify the 
		individual strengths and weaknesses in the learning, memory and recall of a student, so 
		that these can be utilised or worked on in a calm, kind and encouraging manner.
	</p>
	 
	<p>
		Learning styles will be used to supplement individual learning needs. 
		<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/mar/12/no-evidence-to-back-idea-of-learning-styles/">
		Getting a student to think about their learning</a> is what ultimately improves learning, memory and 
		recall, rather than catering for individual learning styles. The use of all four common 
		<a href="https://teach.com/what/teachers-teach/learning-styles/">learning styles</a> 
		together may allow the student to focus on their learning, which is currently thought to 
		improve the students understanding, memory and recall.</p>
	
	
	<p>
		No matter what learning style may be suited or preferred by each individual student, 
		the students all have one thing in common: they all need to be able to sit down and pass 
		exams. This is where the learning style needs to be adapted to the mainly linear format of 
		exams and assignments: reading (and understanding the question) and writing (the correct answers).
