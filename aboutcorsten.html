	<title>Corsten Douglas - the tutor</title>
	
	<p>I am a private tutor with interest and experience in teaching spanning 6 years.<p>
	
	<p>My enthusiasm for teaching began when I obtained a 
		<a href="https://www.sportsleaders.org/courses/awards/young-leader-award/">Junior 
		Sports Leadership Award</a> when I was 15. This enabled me to lead PE lessons given 
		to year 7 and 8 students at my high school. My interest in physical education and sports 
		sparked my enthusiasm for learning more about bioenergetics and metabolism.<p>
	
	<p>During my MRes and PhD, I was responsible for instructing
		undergraduate students to perform experiments and I explained 
		the theory behind each experiment so they could pass exams relating 
		to these topics.</p>
	
	<p>I am involved in <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/becoming-a-better-teacher">continuing professional development for teachers</a>, 
		which emphasises reflective teaching practices to improve the quality of the teaching a student receives.
	
	<p>I volunteered at the very well subscribed 2016 Medical Research Council-Mitochondrial Biology Unit
		stall at the <a href="http://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/tags/science-festival/">Cambridge Science Festival.</a> 
		Explanations of various aspects of biomedical research relating to mitochondria and structural biology were demonstrated.</p>
	        
	<p>My aim in the next year is to continue to inspire young people to enjoy 
		learning by equipping them with the necessary study skills to excel in any subject.</p>
	
	<p> I have been carrying out proteomics and biochemistry research as a 
		PhD student at the MRC-mitochondrial biology unit in Cambridge for the last 4 years. 
		I studied the assembly pathway of human ATP synthase, supervised by <a href="http://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/people/john-walker">Professor Sir John Walker.</a></p>
	
	<p>I graduated in October 2017 with a PhD in biological sciences 
		(biochemistry) from the University of Cambridge. 
		I graduated with an <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/cancer-mres/#profile">MRes in Cancer research</a> 
		at Newcastle University in 2012, and prior to that, I obtained a 
		<a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/undergraduate/programmes/biochemistry/">BSc (Hons) 
		in biochemistry</a> at York University in 2010.</p>

	
	<p>I have and always will be keen to convey my enthusiasm for science to young people, 
		as there is a great need to nurture the development of scientific understanding in 
		order to excel at these sometimes difficult subjects.</p>
