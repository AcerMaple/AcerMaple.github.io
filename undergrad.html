	<p>Dr. Corsten Douglas completed a PhD in Biological sciences (Biochemistry)
	under the supervision of <a href="http://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/people/john-walker">Professor Sir John Walker FRS</a>
	at the MRC mitochondrial biology unit.
	Corsten's thesis, "The assembly pathways of human ATP synthase" showed the requirement of the supernumerary 
	subunits e, f and g in the assembly of the F<sub>O</sub> domain of ATP synthase.</p>
	
	<p>Corsten specialises in the subject of bioenergetics and mitochondria, with an emphasis on ATP synthase, however,
	most undergraduate biology and biochemistry subject areas can be catered for.</p>
