Hi, I am a cognitive computational neuroscientist currently carrying out postdoctoral research with [Bradley Love](//bradlove.org/) in the [Department of Experimental Psychology](//www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/olivia-guest/), [Division of Psuchology and Language Sciences](//www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/profiles/research-staff/olivia-guest), [University College London](//iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=OGUES12).</p>

<p>My research involves the creation and evaluation of computational accounts for categorisation, semantic memory, and conceptual representation. I am currently focussing on deep and shallow neural networks to account for categorisation in healthy adults, patient groups, infants, and animal models.</p>

<p>I am a <a href="//www.software.ac.uk/">Software Sustainability Institute</a> <a href="//software.ac.uk/fellows/olivia-guest">fellow</a> and an <a href="//rescience.github.io/board/">associate editor</a> at <a href="//rescience.github.io/">ReScience</a>. Feel free to <a href="mailto:consulting@oliviaguest.com">contact me</a> for consultation services regarding computational cognitive modelling.</p>
