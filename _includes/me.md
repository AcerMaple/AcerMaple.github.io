Hi, I am a cognitive computational neuroscientist currently carrying out <a href="http://bradlove.org/lab#postdocs">postdoctoral research</a> with <a href="//bradlove.org/">Prof. Bradley C. Love</a> in the <a href="//www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/olivia-guest/">Department of Experimental Psychology</a>, <a href="//www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/profiles/research-staff/olivia-guest">Division of Psychology and Language Sciences</a>, <a href="//iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=OGUES12">University College London</a>.</p>

<p>My undergraduate degree was in Computer Science. After that, I moved on to an MSc in Cognitive and Decision sciences. I then undertook a PhD in Psychology focussing on computational models for semantic memory.</p>

<p>My current research primarily involves the creation and evaluation of computational accounts for categorisation and conceptual representation. I am currently focussing on what deep and shallow artificial neural networks can contribute to our understanding of categorisation in healthy adults, patient groups, infants, and animal models.</p>

<p>I blog about my research and related topics on <a href="http://neuroplausible.com">neuroplausible.com</a>.</p>
