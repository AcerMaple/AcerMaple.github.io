		Using the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-and-centres/departments/education-practice-and-society/science-capital-research/science-capital-teaching-approach">science capital teaching approach</a>, I aim to encourage as many students as possible to enjoy and pursue science subjects such as biology, chemistry and physics. 
	 Having a firm grounding and interest in the logic-based subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics provides a wide range of transferable skills that can be used in almost any career.

		In order for students to excel in their exams, and then at work after their education, Douglas 
	Tutoring aims to increase awareness and engagement in:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Time management</li>
	
	   	<li>Planning</li>
	
	   	<li>Working as a team</li>
	
		<li>Independent studying</li>
	
		<li>Keeping motivated during difficult projects</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Students with these skills will be able to excel in almost any career, not just in science based jobs.
