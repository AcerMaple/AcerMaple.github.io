Todo list
---------
* Convert to using Sass: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sass-converter/tree/master/example
* Can index.html actually be index.md? Something can be done to make this tidier - perhaps each section can be a .md file of its own.
* Use Travis: http://ellismichael.com/technical/2015/06/12/using-travis-ci-with-github-pages/
