#Web Design
 ##This Website

I desgined this website and have been playing around with HTML and CSS since I was about 10 years old. I appreciate the nice feedback I get from people. And if you really like it, you may use this website as a template for building your own. I would especially appreciate it if you <a href="//github.com/oliviaguest/oliviaguest.github.io#fork-destination-box">forked it</a> on github and/or dropped me a message if did use it. The source code is available on <a href="//github.com/oliviaguest/oliviaguest.github.io">github</a>. My site is hosted on <a href="//pages.github.com/">github pages</a>, so what you see is what the source code (pre-compiled <a href="//jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="//yaml.org/">YAML</a>, <a href="//github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki">Liquid</a>, etc.) for my website looks like before github compiles it into static pages.
