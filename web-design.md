## This Website

<p>I desgined this website and have been playing around with HTML and CSS since I was about 10 years old.</p>

<p>I appreciate the nice feedback I get from people. If you really like it, you may use this website as a template for building your own. I would especially appreciate it if you <a href="//github.com/oliviaguest/oliviaguest.github.io">forked it</a> on github and/or dropped me a message if you did use it, as opposed to <a href="https://twitter.com/o_guest/status/696758773235458048">view-source'ing and copy-pasting</a>.</p>

<p>My site is predominantly<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> hosted on <a href="//pages.github.com/">github pages</a>, so what you see is what the source code (pre-compiled <a href="//jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="//yaml.org/">YAML</a>, <a href="//github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki">Liquid</a>, etc.) looks like before github compiles it into static pages.
