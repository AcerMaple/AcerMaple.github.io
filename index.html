		<!--<h1>About Me</h1>      
		  <div>
		      <h2>Current Research Focus</h2>
		
		      <p>My main research involves creating computational models of cognition, specifically category learning in infancy. I am investigating the impact language has on developing cognition, on the formation of category boundaries, and on the ability to generalise from novel experiences.</p>
		
		      <p>I am using various types of connectionist networks, including self-organising maps, to explore the potential roles words can play. Such models can be used to provide support for both mechanistic and functional accounts of how labels can modulate category learning. This computational modelling work aims to examine whether words act as supervisory signals that facilitate the formation of categories, whether they act as features akin to sensory input, or whether words take on both these two roles as a function of development.</p>
		
		      <h2>Academic Background</h2>
		
		      <p>My academic background is inter- and trans-disciplinary. My BSc was in Computer Science at the University of York with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing. Subsequently, I undertook an MSc in Cognitive and Decision Sciences at UCL. I then specialised further with a PhD in Psychology at Birkbeck with a focus on cognitive computational models of semantic memory in both healthy participants and two patient groups: patients with a subtype of frontotemporal neurodegeneration (known as semantic dementia) and patients who survived herpes simplex virus encephalitis.</p>
