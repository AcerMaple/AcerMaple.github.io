## Hello World

Even though my website looks almost identical, I have made some very dramatic changes under the bonnet. I used the following to create a much easier to maintain website:

- "[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator." Moving to Jekyll was made even easier than I am used to by the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repository. 
- "[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world."
- Patience. I had to look back and forth from the old to the new website because I did not want to copy-paste stuff over but I did want it to look almost identical. I moved from old-fashioned CSS to SASS, and from HTML to Markdown, so copying and pasting would have likely introduced too many bugs. Github sends you emails upon emails when your pages do not compile once you move to Jekyll.
